<div class="alert alert-info">This page is about configuring Continuous Testing tests for your continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. If you want to bring your CI/CD metrics and data into Datadog dashboards, see the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/" target="_blank">CI Visibility</a> section.</div>

## Overview

Use the [`@datadog-ci` NPM package][1] to run Continuous Testing tests directly within your CI/CD pipeline. You can automatically halt a build, block a deployment, and roll back a deployment when a Synthetic browser test detects a regression. 

To configure which URL your test starts on, provide a `startUrl` to your test object. Build your own starting URL with any part of your test's original starting URL and include environment variables.

## Setup

### Install the package

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "NPM" %}}

Install the package through NPM:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @datadog/datadog-ci
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Yarn" %}}

Install the package through Yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev @datadog/datadog-ci
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Setup the client

To setup the client, your Datadog API and application keys need to be configured. These keys can be defined in three different ways:

1. Defined as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export DATADOG_API_KEY="<API_KEY>"
   export DATADOG_APP_KEY="<APPLICATION_KEY>"
   ```

2. Passed to the CLI when running your tests:

   ```bash
   yarn datadog-ci synthetics run-tests --apiKey "<API_KEY>" --appKey "<APPLICATION_KEY>"
   ```

3. Or defined in a [global JSON configuration file](#global-configuration-file-options):

   Specify the path to this file using the `--config` flag [when launching your tests](#run-tests). If you set the name of your global configuration file to `datadog-ci.json`, that name is the default.

### Global configuration file options

In the global configuration file, you can set the following advanced options: 

`apiKey`
: The API key used to query the Datadog API.

`appKey`
: The application key used to query the Datadog API.

`datadogSite`
: The Datadog instance to which request is sent. The default is `datadoghq.com`. Your Datadog site is {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}.

`failOnCriticalErrors`
: A boolean flag that fails the CI job if no tests were triggered, or results could not be fetched from Datadog. The default is set to `false`.

`failOnMissingTests`
: A boolean flag that fails the CI job if at least one test is missing in a run (for example, if it has been removed or deleted). The default is set to `false`.

`failOnTimeout`
: A boolean flag that fails the CI job if at least one test exceeds the default test timeout. The default is set to `true`.

`files`
: Glob pattern to detect Synthetic tests configuration files.

`global`
: Overrides for Synthetic tests applied to all tests.

`pollingTimeout`
: **Type**: integer<br>
The duration (in milliseconds) after which `datadog-ci` stops polling for test results. The default is 30 minutes. At the CI level, test results completed after this duration are considered failed.

`proxy`
: The proxy to be used for outgoing connections to Datadog. `host` and `port` keys are mandatory arguments, the `protocol` key defaults to `http`. Supported values for the `protocol` key are `http`, `https`, `socks`, `socks4`, `socks4a`, `socks5`, `socks5h`, `pac+data`, `pac+file`, `pac+ftp`, `pac+http`, and `pac+https`. The library used to configure the proxy is the [proxy-agent][2] library.

`subdomain`
: The name of the custom subdomain set to access your Datadog application. If the URL used to access Datadog is `myorg.datadoghq.com`, the `subdomain` value needs to be set to `myorg`.

`tunnel`
: Use the [testing tunnel][3] to execute your test batch.

`testSearchQuery`
: Pass a query to select which Synthetic tests to run. If you are running tests in the CLI, use the `-s` flag.

#### Use a proxy

It is possible to configure a proxy to be used for outgoing connections to Datadog using the `proxy` key of the global configuration file.

As the [`proxy-agent` library][2] is used to configure the proxy, the supported protocols include `http`, `https`, `socks`, `socks4`, `socks4a`, `socks5`, `socks5h`, `pac+data`, `pac+file`, `pac+ftp`, `pac+http`, and `pac+https`. The `proxy` key of the global configuration file is passed to a new `proxy-agent` instance, which means the same configuration for the library is supported.

**Note**: `host` and `port` keys are mandatory arguments and the `protocol` key defaults to `http` if not defined.

For example: 

{{< code-block lang="json" filename="Global Configuration File" disable_copy="false" collapsible="true" >}}
{
    "apiKey": "<DATADOG_API_KEY>",
    "appKey": "<DATADOG_APPLICATION_KEY>",
    "datadogSite": "datadoghq.com", // You can use another Datadog site. By default, requests are sent to Datadog US1. 
    "files": "{,!(node_modules)/**/}*.synthetics.json",
    "failOnCriticalErrors": false,
    "failOnMissingTests": false,
    "failOnTimeout": true,
    "global": {
        "allowInsecureCertificates": true,
        "basicAuth": { "username": "test", "password": "test" },
        "body": "{\"fakeContent\":true}",
        "bodyType": "application/json",
        "cookies": "name1=value1;name2=value2;",
        "deviceIds": ["laptop_large"],
        "followRedirects": true,
        "headers": { "<NEW_HEADER>": "<NEW_VALUE>" },
        "locations": ["aws:us-west-1"],
        "retry": { "count": 2, "interval": 300 },
        "executionRule": "blocking",
        "startUrlSubstitutionRegex": "s/(https://www.)(.*)/$1extra-$2/",
        "startUrl": "{{URL}}?static_hash={{STATIC_HASH}}",
        "variables": { "titleVariable": "new value" },
        "pollingTimeout": 180000
    },
    "proxy": {
      "auth": {
        "username": "login",
        "password": "pwd"
      },
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 3128,
      "protocol": "http"
    },
    "subdomain": "subdomainname",
    "tunnel": true
}
{{< /code-block >}}

### Command line options

If the organization uses a custom sub-domain to access Datadog, this needs to be set in the `DATADOG_SUBDOMAIN` environment variable or in the global configuration file under the `subdomain` key in order to properly display the test results URL. 

For example, if the URL used to access Datadog is `myorg.datadoghq.com`, set the environment variable to `myorg`:

```bash
export DATADOG_SUBDOMAIN="myorg"
```

You can use `DATADOG_SYNTHETICS_LOCATIONS` to override the locations where your tests run. Locations should be separated with `;`. The configuration in test files takes precedence over other overrides.

```bash
export DATADOG_SYNTHETICS_LOCATIONS="aws:us-east-1;aws:us-east-2"
```

### API

By default, `datadog-ci` runs at the root of the working directory and finds `{,!(node_modules)/**/}*.synthetics.json` files (every file ending with `.synthetics.json`, except for those in the `node_modules` folder). The tool loads `datadog-ci.json`, which can be overridden through the `--config` argument.

For example:

{{< code-block lang="json" filename="Configuration File" disable_copy="false" collapsible="true" >}}
{
  "apiKey": "<DATADOG_API_KEY>",
  "appKey": "<DATADOG_APPLICATION_KEY>",
  "datadogSite": "datadoghq.com",
  "failOnCriticalErrors": true,
  "failOnMissingTests": true,
  "failOnTimeout": true,
  "files": "{,!(node_modules)/**/}*.synthetics.json",
  "global": {
    "allowInsecureCertificates": true,
    "basicAuth": {"username": "test", "password": "test"},
    "body": "{\"fakeContent\":true}",
    "bodyType": "application/json",
    "cookies": "name1=value1;name2=value2;",
    "defaultStepTimeout": 15,
    "deviceIds": ["chrome.laptop_large"],
    "executionRule": "skipped",
    "followRedirects": true,
    "headers": {"NEW_HEADER": "NEW VALUE"},
    "locations": ["aws:us-east-1"],
    "retry": {"count": 2, "interval": 300},
    "startUrl": "{{URL}}?static_hash={{STATIC_HASH}}",
    "startUrlSubstitutionRegex": "s/(https://www.)(.*)/$1extra-$2/",
    "variables": {"NEW_VARIABLE": "NEW VARIABLE"},
    "pollingTimeout": 120000
  },
  "proxy": {
    "auth": {
      "username": "login",
      "password": "pwd"
    },
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3128,
    "protocol": "http"
  },
  "subdomain": "subdomainname",
  "tunnel": true
}
{{< /code-block >}}

## Run tests

You can decide to have the CLI auto-discover all your `**/*.synthetics.json` Synthetic tests (or all the tests associated to the path specified in your [global configuration file](#global-configuration-file-options)) or to specify the tests you want to run using the `-p,--public-id` flag.

Run tests by executing the CLI:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab "Yarn" %}}

The `run-tests` sub-command runs the tests discovered in the folder according to the `files` configuration key. It accepts the `--public-id` (or shorthand `-p`) argument to trigger only the specified test. It can be set multiple times to run multiple tests:

```bash
yarn datadog-ci synthetics run-tests --public-id pub-lic-id1 --public-id pub-lic-id2
```

It is also possible to trigger tests corresponding to a search query by using the flag `--search` (or shorthand `-s`). With this option, the global configuration overrides applies to all tests discovered with the search query.

```bash
yarn datadog-ci synthetics run-tests -s 'tag:e2e-tests' --config global.config.json
```

You can use `--files` (shorthand `-f`) to override the global file selector when you want to run multiple suites in parallel with a single global configuration file.

```bash
yarn datadog-ci synthetics run-tests -f ./component-1/**/*.synthetics.json -f ./component-2/**/*.synthetics.json
```

You can also pass variables as arguments using `--variable KEY=VALUE`.

```bash
yarn datadog-ci synthetics run-tests -f ./component-1/**/*.synthetics.json -v PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
```

**Note**: If you are launching your tests with a custom global configuration file, append your command with `--config <PATH_TO_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "NPM" %}}

Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "datadog-ci-synthetics": "datadog-ci synthetics run-tests"
  }
}
```

Then, run:

```bash
npm run datadog-ci-synthetics
```

**Note**: If you are launching your tests with a custom global configuration file, append the command associated to your `datadog-ci-synthetics` script with `--config <PATH_TO_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE`.

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Failure modes flags

- `--failOnTimeout` (or `--no-failOnTimeout`) makes the CI fail (or pass) if one of the results exceeds its test timeout.
- `--failOnCriticalErrors` makes the CI fail if tests were not triggered or if results could not be fetched.
- `--failOnMissingTests` makes the CI fail if at least one test is missing.

### Test files

Your test files must be named with a `.synthetics.json` suffix.

```json
// myTest.synthetics.json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "<TEST_PUBLIC_ID>",
      "config": {
        "allowInsecureCertificates": true,
        "basicAuth": {"username": "test", "password": "test"},
        "body": "{\"fakeContent\":true}",
        "bodyType": "application/json",
        "cookies": "name1=value1;name2=value2;",
        "defaultStepTimeout": 15,
        "deviceIds": ["chrome.laptop_large"],
        "executionRule": "skipped",
        "followRedirects": true,
        "headers": {"NEW_HEADER": "NEW VALUE"},
        "locations": ["aws:us-east-1"],
        "pollingTimeout": 30000,
        "retry": {"count": 2, "interval": 300},
        "startUrl": "{{URL}}?static_hash={{STATIC_HASH}}",
        "startUrlSubstitutionRegex": "s/(https://www.)(.*)/$1extra-$2/",
        "variables": {"MY_VARIABLE": "new title"}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `<TEST_PUBLIC_ID>` can be either the identifier of the test found in the URL of a test details page (for example, for `https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/details/abc-def-ghi`, it would be `abc-def-ghi`) or the full URL to the details page (for example, directly `https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/details/abc-def-ghi`).

All options under the `config` key are optional and allow overriding of the test configuration as stored in Datadog.

// Convert this into a table

- `allowInsecureCertificates`: (boolean) disable certificate checks in API tests.
- `basicAuth`: (object) credentials to provide in case a basic authentication is encountered.
  - `username`: (string) username to use in basic authentication.
  - `password`: (string) password to use in basic authentication.
- `body`: (string) data to send in a synthetics API test.
- `bodyType`: (string) type of the data sent in a synthetics API test.
- `cookies`: (string or object) use provided string as Cookie header in API or Browser test, in addition or in replacement.
  - if a string, it will be used to replace the original cookies.
  - if an object, its format must be `{append?: boolean, value: string}` and depending on the value of `append`, it will be appended or will replace the original cookies.
- `defaultStepTimeout`: (number) maximum duration of steps in seconds for Browser tests, does not override individually set step timeouts.
- `deviceIds`: (array) list of devices on which to run the Browser test.
- `executionRule`: (string) execution rule of the test: it defines the behavior of the CLI in case of a failing test, it can be either:
  - `blocking`: the CLI returns an error if the test fails.
  - `non_blocking`: the CLI only prints a warning if the test fails.
  - `skipped`: the test is not executed at all.
- `followRedirects`: (boolean) indicates whether to follow or not HTTP redirections in API tests.
- `headers`: (object) headers to replace in the test. This object should contain as keys the name of the header to replace and as values the new value of the header.
- `locations`: (array) list of locations from which the test should be run.
- `pollingTimeout`: (integer) maximum duration in milliseconds of a test, if execution exceeds this value it is considered failed.
- `retry`: (object) retry policy for the test.
  - `count`: (integer) number of attempts to perform in case of test failure.
  - `interval`: (integer) interval between the attempts (in milliseconds).
- `startUrl`: (string) new start URL to provide to the test. Variables specified in brackets (`{{ EXAMPLE }}`) found in environment variables are replaced.
- `startUrlSubstitutionRegex`: (string) regex to modify the starting URL of the test (browser and HTTP tests only), whether it was given by the original test or by the configuration override `startUrl`. If the URL contains variables, this regex will be applied after the interpolation of the variables. The format is `s/your_regex/your_substitution/modifiers` and follow Javascript regex syntax, for instance `s/(https://www.)(.*)/$1extra-$2/` to transform `https://www.example.com` into `https://www.extra-example.com`.
- `variables`: (object) variables to replace in the test. This object should contain as keys the name of the variable to replace and as values the new value of the variable.

## Use the testing tunnel

You can combine variable overrides with the [Continuous Testing Tunnel][3] to run tests within your development environment. The testing tunnel creates an end-to-end encrypted HTTP proxy between your infrastructure and Datadog that allows all test requests sent through the CLI to be automatically routed through the `datadog-ci` client. This allows you to run tests with end-to-end encryption at every stage of your software development lifecycle, from pre-production environments to your production system.

## End-to-end testing process

To verify the Synthetics command works as expected, trigger a test run and verify it returns 0:

```bash
export DATADOG_API_KEY='<API key>'
export DATADOG_APP_KEY='<application key>'

yarn datadog-ci synthetics run-tests --public-id abc-def-ghi
```

Successful output should look like this:

```bash
[abc-def-ghi] Trigger test "Check on testing.website"
[abc-def-ghi] Waiting results for "Check on testing.website"


=== REPORT ===

```

### Reporters

Two reporters are supported out-of-the-box:

1. `stdout`
2. JUnit

To enable the JUnit report, pass the `--jUnitReport` (`-j` shorthand) in your command, specifying a filename for your JUnit XML report.

```bash
yarn datadog-ci synthetics run-tests -s 'tag:e2e-tests' --config global.config.json --jUnitReport e2e-test-junit
```

Reporters can hook themselves into the `MainReporter` of the command.

## View test results

You can see results for CI batches by clicking on a batch in the [Continuous Testing Explorer][4], or by clicking on a test in the [Synthetic Tests page][5].

You can also see the outcome of test executions directly in your CI as your tests are being executed. To identify what caused a test to fail, look at the execution logs and search for causes of the failed assertion.
